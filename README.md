# Intelligent Camera Angle & Scene Change Detection System

An automated video analysis system that detects **camera angle changes and scene transitions** using Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques.

---

# Problem
Manual identification of camera angle changes and scene transitions in videos is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project automates the process to enable fast and reliable video segmentation.

---

# Models & Tools
- PySceneDetect – Scene boundary detection  
- K-Means Clustering – Color histogram similarity analysis  
- Python, OpenCV, NumPy  

---

# Architecture
Input Video
→ Frame Extraction
→ Preprocessing
→ PySceneDetect
→ Feature Extraction
→ K-Means Clustering
→ Decision Engine
→ Crop & Save Scenes
→ Output (Scenes + Timestamps)


---

# Performance (11-Minute Video)
- Scene detection: 30–35 seconds  
- Crop & save scenes: 2–2.5 minutes  

---

# Accuracy
- PySceneDetect: 70–90%  
- K-Means: ~85%  

---

# Limitations
- Slower for high-resolution videos  
- Sensitive to extreme lighting changes  

---

#  Future Enhancements
- Train deep learning models with labeled datasets  
- Automatic genre classification (Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.)  
- GPU acceleration
